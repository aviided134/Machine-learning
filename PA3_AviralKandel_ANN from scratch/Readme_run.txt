Steps to execute the program:
1. After downloading the submission file “PA3_Aviral.zip”, unzip this file.
2. Navigate to the code.
3. There will be four files, named "ANN1.m", "ANN2.m", ANN5.m" and "ANN10.m". These codes iterate for 2000 loops.
4. Place these files in your octave or MATLAB workspace. You will see these files listed from within your octave under the        	Downloads folder.
5. Click on “RUN” to start the program after the code is loaded on the workspace.
6. The final and best training error and test error is obtained and is also printed on the console of the octave.
